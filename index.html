This question manipulates a string, a one-dimensional array, and a two-dimensional array. In parts (a) and (b), you will write methods to reverse a string and to create a palindrome from a given string. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same from right to left as from left to right. For example, "atoyota" and "dad" are palindromes.) In parts (c) and (d), you will replace the strings in a one-dimensional array and a two-dimensional array with palindrome versions of the strings.

Consider the following incomplete StringUtil class, which contains three static methods: reverse, changeToPalindrome, and changeArrayToPalindromes.

public class StringUtil
{
	/** Returns a string whose characters are in reverse order of str.
	 *  Precondition:  str is not null.
	 *  @param str the given string
	 *  @return str in reverse order 
	 */
	public static String reverse(String str)
	{ /* to be implemented in part(a) */}

	/** Returns a palindrome string, one that reads the same from
	 *  right to left and left to right.
	 *  Precondition:  str is not null and has n characters, n>=1.
	 *  Postcondition:
	 *   - Returned string is a palindrome with n characters, whose opening
	 *     characters are the first n/2 characters of str if n is even.
	 *   - If n is odd, the opening characters of the returned string
	 *     are the first (n/2 + 1) characters of str.
	 *  @param str the given string
	 *  @return a palindrome version of str
	 */
	public static String changeToPalindrome(String str)
	{ /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }

	/** Changes each element of arr to be a palindrome.
	 *  Precondition:  arr is an array of non-null strings.
	 *  Postcondition: Each element of arr is a palindrome, as discussed in part (b).
	 *  @param arr the array to be changed
	 */
	public static void changeArrayToPalindromes(String[] arr)
	{ /* to be implemented in part (c) */ }

	//Other methods not shown.
}

Part (a)
Write the StringUtil method reverse, which reverses the characters of its String parameter. For example, a call to reverse("cat") will return "tac", and a call to reverse("p") will return "p".

Complete method reverse below:

/** Returns a string whose characters are in reverse order of str.
 *  Precondition:  str is not null.
 *  @param str the given string
 *  @return str in reverse order
 */
public static String reverse(String str)

Part (b)
Write the StringUtil method changeToPalindrome, that returns a palindrome string from its parameter str as follows:

If str contains an even number of characters, n, the returned string is a palindrome that consists of the first n/2 characters of str, followed by characters that create a palindrome. For example, changeToPalindrome("balk") returns "baab", and changeToPalindrome("oh") returns "oo".

If str contains an odd number of characters, n, the returned string is a palindrome that consists of the first (n/2)+1 characters of str, followed by characters that create a palindrome. For example, changeToPalindrome("break") returns "brerb", and changeToPalindrome("oha") returns "oho".

Note that in each case---for n even or n odd---the string returned by changeToPalindrome contains n characters, and that the last n/2 characters of the parameter string have been replaced.

Complete method changeToPalindrome below.

/** Returns a palindrome string, one that reads the same from
 *  right to left and left to right.
 *  Precondition:  str is not null and has n characters, n>=1.
 *  Postcondition:
 *   - Returned string is a palindrome with n characters, whose opening
 *     characters are the first n/2 characters of str if n is even.
 *   - If n is odd, the opening characters of the returned string
 *     are the first (n/2 + 1) characters of str.
 *  @param str the given string
 *  @return a palindrome version of str
 */
public static String changeToPalindrome(String str)

Part (c)
Write the StringUtil method changeArrayToPalindromes. This method replaces each string in its array parameter with a palindrome, as described in part (b). For example, if arr is {"hat", "frame", "Mary"}, a call to changeArrayToPalindromes(arr) should change arr to {"hah", "frarf", "MaaM"}. In writing changeArrayToPalindromes, your method must use the StringUtil method changeToPalindrome. You may assume changeToPalindrome works as specified, regardless of what you wrote in part (b).

Complete method changeArrayToPalindromes below.

/** Changes each element of arr to be a palindrome.
 *  Precondition:  arr is an array of non-null strings.
 *  Postcondition: Each element of arr is a palindrome, as discussed in part (b).
 *  @param arr the array to be changed
 */
public static void changeArrayToPalindromes(String[] arr)

Part (d)
Consider the following incomplete Matrix class, which represents a two-dimensional matrix of strings.

public class Matrix
{
	private String [][] mat;

	public Matrix (String [][] m)
	{ mat = m; }

	/** Changes each element of mat to be a palindrome.
	 *  Precondition:  mat contains non-null strings.
	 *  Postcondition: Each element of mat is a palindrome whose first
	 *               half is the first half of the original string.
	 */
	public void changeMatrixToPalindromes()
	{ /* to be implemented in part (d) */ }

	//Other instance variables, constructors, and methods are not shown.
}

Write the matrix method changeMatrixToPalindromes. This method converts each string in mat to a palindrome, as specified in part (b).

For example,if mat1 refers to a Matrix object, then the call mat1.changeMatrixToPalindromes() will change the matrix as shown below:

	<img src="https://github.com/League-level5/Prac_Question_3/blob/gh-pages/chart4.png?raw=true">

In writing changeMatrixToPalindromes, you must call the changeArrayToPalindromes method in part (c). Assume that changeArrayToPalindromes works correctly regardless of what you wrote in part (c).

Complete method changeMatrixToPalindromes below.

/** Changes each element of mat to be a palindrome.
 *  Precondition:  mat contains non-null strings.
 *  Postcondition: Each element of mat is a palindrome whose first
 *               half is the first half of the original string.
